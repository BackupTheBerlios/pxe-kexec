pxe-kexec - Read PXE configuration file and kexec entries


=head1 SYNOPSIS

pxe-kexec [options] <tftp_server>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pxe-kexec> is a tool that fetches PXE configuration from a TFTP server,
reads that PXE configuration file, prompts the user for an boot entry,
downloads the specified kernel and initrd and finally executes the both using
B<kexec>.

It's meant to be used in an environment where pre-defined PXE configurations
exist but the user wants to use B<kexec> instead of rebooting.

Normally, the I<tftp_server> must be specified as first argument. If there's
no TFTP server specified, B<pxe-kexec> looks in the DHCP info file for the DHCP
server and uses this one as TFTP server. This only works when the TFTP server
is running on the same machine as the DHCP server.

=head1 OPTIONS

Following options can be specified:

=over 7

=item B<-h> | B<--help>

Prints a short help.

=item B<-v> | B<--version>

Prints the version number to standard output.

=item B<-i> | B<--interface> I<netif>

Uses I<netif> instead of the first (non-loopback and up) interface that is
found. Example: "eth5".

=item B<-n> | B<--noconfirm>

Don't ask the user for confirmation before booting an entry. Use that option
with care!

=item B<-D> | B<--debug>

Enable debugging output. That's good for finding (and fixing!) bugs.

=item B<-d> | B<--nodelete>

Keep downloaded files.

=item B<-F> | B<--ftp>

Always use FTP instead of TFTP. Useful for servers that share TFTP root and
FTP root. (Passive) FTP has the advantage that it passes firewalls better
than TFTP.
