pxe-kexec
---------

pxe-kexec reads a PXE Linux configuration file (kernel, initrd, command line)
and uses kexec to boot an entry. It is meant to be a simple-to-use alternative
to use kexec in an environment where pre-defined PXE configuration files exist,
to safe some typing time.

Read more information in the manpage, and remember to have fun!
