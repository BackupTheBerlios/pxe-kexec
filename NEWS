0.2.0
-----
  - Don't ignore lines where the keyword "say" or "label" is followed by a tab
    instead of a space.
  - Parse the keywords case-insensitive (e.g. accept also 'SAY', not only
    'say').
  - Add also the last entry to the list of entries.
  - Don't clutter the screen when testing for the existence of 'kexec'.
  - Specify the default label with '-l <label>' instead of an argument.
  - Change the behaviour of '--dry-run' to just print every call to kexec on
    stderr. Previously, just the final 'kexec -e' was not executed. Also don't
    switch the virtual terminal and just print a message that this would be
    done.
  - Print an error message if the effective user ID does not belong root.
  - Implement whitelist for distributions that have kexec in their reboot
    scripts and add option '--ignore-whitelist' to ignore that whitelist and
    force a kexec-based reboot.
  - Implement '--force' option to have also the old behaviour ('kexec -e' at
    the end of pxe-kexec).
  - Implement '--print-distribution' option that just prints out what Linux
    flavour we detected on the currently running system.
  - Document CMake in INSTALL.
